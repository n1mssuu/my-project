I’m learning English to build a future without borders. My goal is to study in top universities, work on international projects, and become the kind of person who can compete globally. English is not just a school subject for me; it’s a tool for success. I want to communicate with the world, learn from the best, and create opportunities that my past generations never had. I work on my English every day, because I know fluency will unlock scholarships, careers, and a life full of possibilities.
